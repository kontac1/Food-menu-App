# Food-menu-App-React
Developed a food menu App using react to allow people to search for recipes.


#lesson learned
This porject allow me to learn more about data management in react; because the Api used in the project 
only allow limited request from users everytime our page render. Therefore, I had to use an userEffect to only run the application when the page first load. I develop a constant variable to make the request to the api only when the constant varibale change.
